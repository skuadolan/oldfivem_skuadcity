	Ensure plate has a Max of 7 Character and at least 1 number eg: PDM 678

	The script will store the plate as PDM 678 but will strip the numbers and spaces away to authorise use eg: PDM

	ensure you only put the Letters in your plate in the Config.    

-- [[ Use table update ]] -- 

	If you have a script for handing over keys to vehicle then you will need to update the stored table this is simple to do

	-- plate = Vehicle Plate ( GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle) )
	-- Owner = new owners Server ID (GetPlayerServerId(closestPlayer))
		
		local closestPlayer, closestDistance = ESX.Game.GetClosestPlayer()
		TriggerServerEvent('shorty_slocks:transferOwner', plate, owner)

-- [[ Call for Theft Systems ]] --

	-- Plate = Vehicle Plate ( GetVehicleNumberPlateText(vehicle) )

	TriggerServerEvent('shorty_slocks:breakIn', Plate)

-- [[ Call for Menu Systems ]] --

	TriggerClientEvent('shorty_slocks:setvehicleLockMenu', 'unlock') - To Unlock can also use, False or 1
